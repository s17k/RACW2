Installing the FF planner:
Included in this directory is a compiled version of the MetricFF planner in the file: ff
To be able to run the planner you must make the file executable by running this command:
$ chmod u+x ff

Once you have done this you can run the planner using this command:
$ ./ff -o <domain-file> -f <problem-file>

If you are not working on DICE or if this doesn't work for you, you can download and compile the planner on your own. 
The source code can be downloaded from: https://fai.cs.uni-saarland.de/hoffmann/ff/Metric-FF-v2.1.tgz
Simply follow the instructions in the README file in that directory.
